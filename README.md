London Airbnb Data Cleaning Project

In this project, I took a large, messy dataset of London Airbnb listings and turned it into something clean, consistent, and analysis-ready. The original dataset had nearly 97,000 rows and dozens of mixed-type columns, with lots of missing values, inconsistent formats, and clutter that made it hard to work with. So I built a thoughtful cleaning workflow — validating and correcting data types, removing truly useless columns, handling missing values logically, converting pricing and percentage values to the right formats, and standardizing Boolean and datetime fields.

Rather than just blindly deleting things, every step was guided by real analytical value: what do we need for meaningful exploration and modeling? The result is a streamlined dataset with less noise, clearer structure, and far better usability for downstream analysis or machine learning.
